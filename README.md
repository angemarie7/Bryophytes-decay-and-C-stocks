# Bryophytes-decay-and-C-stocks
#Project title: Nine-years effect of harvesting and mechanical site preparation on bryophyte decomposition and carbon stocks in a boreal forested peatland.
##Introduction
The boreal forest peatlands represent the largest terrestrial soil carbon stock. Site preparation has been shown to be an essential step in ensuring the growth of planted seedlings in this environment. However, while this treatment can accumulate C in trees, it can reduce soil C stocks. The data and code were used to assess the nine-year effects of silvicultural treatments of different intensity (harvesting and harvesting followed by mechanical site preparation) on the decomposition rates of common bryophyteâ€™s species and on soil C stocks.
##Data
The study area is located in the Clay Belt region of northwestern Quebec (Canada). There are two databases related to: (1) decompostion rate and (2) to soil C stocks. The first database contains 487 mass loss percent of three bryophytes species (Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum capillifolium, and Sphagnum fuscum) for one and two growing seasons (i.e., 4 months and 16 months, June to October 2019 and June 2019 to October 2020) and some micro-environmental variables. the microenvironmental variables involved, the Air and soil temperature, soil layer types (fibric, mesic, humic and mineral), water table fluctuations, organic layer thickness and canopy openness. The other database concerned soil carbon stock.
##Codes
There are 2 codes: 
The first code regroups the analysis on decomposition, Principal component analysis and C stoks analysis. 
Another code on common variables declaration and data imported decay.
