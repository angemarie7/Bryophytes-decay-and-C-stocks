# Bryophytes-decay-and-C-stocks
data and codes relate to the effect of harvesting and mechanical site preparation on bryophyte decomposition and carbon stocks in a boreal forested peatland.
The study area is located in the Clay Belt region of northwestern Quebec (Canada).
The database contains 487 mass loss percent of three bryophytes species (Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum capillifolium, and Sphagnum fuscum) 
for one and two growing seasons (i.e., 4 months and 16 months, June to October 2019 and June 2019 to October 2020) and some micro-environmental variables. 
the microenvironmental variables involved, the Air and soil temperature , soil layer types (fibric, mesic, humic and mineral), water table fluctuations,
organic layer thickness  and canopy openness.
The other database concerned soil carbon stock.
